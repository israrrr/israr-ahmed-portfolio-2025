## 🕵️‍♂️ The Forensic Narrative
I used to investigate digital crime scenes; now I investigate brand narratives. Coming from a background in **Forensics and Cybersecurity**, I view Brand Strategy as Root Cause Analysis and UI/UX as System Security. 

I don't start with shapes; I start with **evidence**. My process is "Investigation First, Design Second"—uncovering the raw, authentic truth of a story and translating that logic into an emotion that users can feel.
